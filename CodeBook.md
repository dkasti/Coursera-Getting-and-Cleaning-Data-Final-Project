The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz are captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. Each of these features is the average of the corresponding values over all the windows.
- Its activity name. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAccXYZ and tGyroXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAccXYZ and tGravityAccXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerkXYZ and tBodyGyroJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAccXYZ, fBodyAccJerkXYZ, fBodyGyroXYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate the variables, which are intrinsically the corresponding average values over all the windows, of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* tBodyAccXYZ
* tGravityAccXYZ
* tBodyAccJerkXYZ
* tBodyGyroXYZ
* tBodyGyroJerkXYZ

* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAccXYZ
* fBodyAccJerkXYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* Mean: Mean value
* Std(): Standard deviation
* MeanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
